# Reinforcement Learning Project

This project explores reinforcement learning concepts, including Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), Q-learning, SARSA, and Policy Gradient methods. The project includes a detailed analysis of reinforcement learning techniques and their applications.

## Project Overview
The project demonstrates how reinforcement learning can be used for decision-making problems, with practical examples implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (if applicable)
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## How to Run
1. Open `apprentissage-par-renforcement.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the steps to explore various reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Results and Visuals
Refer to the [PDF document](./Apprentissage_par_renforcement.pdf) for an in-depth explanation, results, and visuals.
