# Multilingual Chatbot using NLP and Neural Networks

This project involves creating a multilingual chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and neural networks. 
The chatbot can understand and respond in multiple languages.

## Project Overview
The chatbot uses NLP techniques to process text and neural networks to classify user inputs into categories and respond appropriately.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** for the web interface
- **Keras** for building the neural network
- **NLTK** for NLP (tokenization, stemming)
- **Google Translator API** for language translation

## Features
- Multilingual support using NLP and Google Translator.
- Neural network-based classification for intelligent responses.
- Web interface built using Streamlit.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`.

## Results/Visuals
- (Add visuals or screenshots of the chatbot interface and results)

## Future Improvements
- Add more languages.
- Improve response accuracy with additional training data.
