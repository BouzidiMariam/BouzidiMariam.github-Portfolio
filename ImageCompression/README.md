# Image Compression Using a Convolutional Autoencoder

This project demonstrates how to use a convolutional autoencoder for compressing and reconstructing facial images, reducing their dimensionality while retaining key features.

## Project Overview
The convolutional autoencoder was trained on grayscale facial images, compressing them into a lower-dimensional space and then reconstructing them with minimal loss. This technique is effective for tasks such as image compression, noise reduction, and feature extraction.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building the convolutional autoencoder
- **Jupyter Notebook** for code implementation
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib** for data manipulation and visualization

## How to Run
1. Open `image-compression.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells step by step to train and evaluate the convolutional autoencoder.

## Results and Visuals
Refer to the [PDF report](./Image-Compression.pdf) for a detailed explanation of the methodology, results, and future work.
