# Machine Learning Project for Metaverse Transactions

This project involves developing a machine learning application using Python and Streamlit to classify transaction risks in the Metaverse into three categories: low risk, moderate risk, and high risk.

## Project Overview
The application compares different machine learning models and allows users to interact with them using a Streamlit interface. The project is based on a dataset of over 78,600 transactions in the Metaverse.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** for the web interface
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models
- **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for data processing and visualization

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have the required libraries by installing them with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`.
